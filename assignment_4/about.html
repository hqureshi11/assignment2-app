                    <p>It all started in a small kitchen in Squirrel Hill in 1984 - Van Halen’s “Jump” was blasting off the turntable, test tubes littered the counter,  and the room smelled of freshly-baked goodness. Betty Bunbun, a chemistry student at Carnegie Mellon University, spent all summer exploring hundreds of ingredient combinations to concoct the perfect cinnamon bun. </p>
                    <p> Sugar and rose water. Walnut and tamarind. Rosemary and olive oil. Combinations of ingredients like these have led to the flavor combinations we’re known for. Betty discovered late that summer the perfect combination to create her signature Original Cinnamon Bun. After selling them every day at the beginning of her Programming Usable Interfaces class (and selling out rather quickly!), Betty opened the first Bun Bun Bake Shop stand on the Carnegie Mellon campus. After her graduation, she opened a small shop on a bustling section of Squirrel Hill, where Betty still crafts her signature desserts to this very day. </p>
                    <p> After decades of love and tender baking, Bun Bun Bake Shop has grown to become one of the premiere bakeries in Western Pennsylvania. And now, you can have all of your favorites delivered right to your doorstep! </p>
